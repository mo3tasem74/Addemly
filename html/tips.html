       <div>Public speaking is probably one of the most important, yet terrifying, activities for young environmental professionals. Many of us got into this field because we love communing with nature, not necessarily people. But without professionals out there communicating their work to the public very little would ever change. Not everyone takes the time to read a technical report, but they may tune in to an interview or show up at a talk to hear more. When planning to present your work to just a few people, or even a large audience, the same tips will ensure that you communicate your story effectively:</div>
       <div>
           <h1>Know your facts</h1>
           <p>Before you communicate any information, be sure that you have the key details on the tip of your tongue. Nothing is worse than trying to “tell your story” but forgetting the actual details of the results. This doesn’t require that you be an expert, but it does require that you put in the time to study the key information first.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Know your audience</h1>
            <p>Whom you are talking to will inform the tone of your talk and the level of detail included. Sometimes it is important to focus on the conclusions (say for an audience of land managers), while other times, you will need to spend much more time going over the methods (say for a scientific audience who will want to vet your approach).</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Stick to your “story”</h1>
        <p> Remember that you have a specific story that you want to communicate. Present only the key information associated with that story so that you don’t lose your audience in the details.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Make it a conversation</h1>
        <p> While many people depend on slides or other visuals to communicate their story, don’t let these aids get in the way of your connection to your audience. You should be making eye contact with audience members as if you were talking to each one individually.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h1>Relax</h1>
        <p>Take a breath. Be comfortable with natural pauses and silent spaces. Taking a moment to collect your thoughts before proceeding to the next point gives your audience a chance to catch up was well. This is not brain surgery, and no one expects you to be perfect.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h1>Practice</h1>
        <p>Nothing helps you to relax more than practicing the story you are going to tell. Practice out loud to yourself, or even do a dry run in front of a friendly audience. This is especially useful to help modify content. Just like having a fresh set of eyes for revisions of your writing, having a fresh set of ears listen to your talk can be valuable in making sure your story will be clear to the audience.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>START STRONG</h1>
        <p>How you start your presentation is critical! An audience is going to decide if they are going to listen to you by how you begin. To engage the audience immediately, tell an interesting story, show an intriguing picture or do something entertaining. By using one of these public speaking techniques, your audience will be hooked.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>CREATE VARIETY</h1>
        <p>One way to master the art of public speaking is to create variety in your presentation. It will keep your audience interested! Use video. Use eye catching images. Involve your audience as much as possible! Ask them questions to keep them alert. Not talking all of the time, and using different ways to communicate your idea definitely helps.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h1>SPEAK CLEARLY</h1>
        <p>Good public speakers make a presentation even better by speaking clearly. You want your audience to hear what you are saying, so make sure you speak at a good volume. If the student at the back of the room can hear you, then your volume is great!
            We understand this can be difficult when you are nervous. Try to look forward to project your voice, make eye contact with the audience and following our techniques above if you’re feeling nervous!
            Emphasis words you want your audience to hear. Add suspense and intrigue by speaking more softly. Use body language as well as your voice volume to increase excitement!
            Practice makes perfect here. Joining us at Summer Boarding Courses will show you how to improve your interpersonal communication skills and decrease your public speaking anxiety. Find out more about practicing your presentation skills with us during our Time to Shine projects.

    <div>
        <h1>TRY YOUR BEST TO BE CONFIDENT</h1>
        <p>If our calming techniques do not work, it is still possible that people cannot see just how nervous you actually are! Even if you do not feel confident, acting confident helps.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>SPEAK AT A GOOD PACE</h1>
        <p>Speaking at a pace where the audience can understand you is so important when you deliver a presentation. Keeping an optimal pace provides time for the listeners to understand the content, take notes, and ask questions.
            A good presenter should learn not to speak too quickly, because they need to give time for the audience to understand what is being said. At the same time, the pace should not be so slow that the presenter runs out of time to complete the presentation (and the audience becomes bored!).
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h1>HAVE A PLAN B</h1>
        <p>If your presentation is on a computer or hard drive, make sure you have a backup! Having your notes in paper format and some images which do not rely on technology will help you if worst comes to worst</p>
